## Weather Section
- Got current location of user -latitude and longitude using Geolocation
- By passing latitude and longitude as parameters for the AJAX call, got current weather forecast info from Dark Sky API
- Used bootstrap jumbotron to display current info - Date, Time, Temperature, Weather Status, weather icon
- Used bootstrap jumbotron to display hourly info - Time, Temperature, Weather Status, weather icon
<pre>- used for in loop to access API info 
<pre>- converted the time given by API in msecs to secs and used momentjs to display the time in desired format 
<pre>- used font Awesome 5 to access the weather icons since it wasn't provided by the Dark Sky API
<pre>- Gave animations to buttons and icons using CSS library animate.css
